# Crop-Prediction-using-Data-Mining
Farmers, being part of the largest working sector of India, are not being able to make enough profit due to inadequate yield, unpredictable rainfall and drought conditions. Unfortunate circumstances like climate change, excessive use of fertilizers, and decline in soil quality also lead to insufficient production. By implementing data mining strategies, an analysis is performed using geographical and climatic data, and the appropriate crop to be cultivated in order to get a better yield is predicted. This analysis is based on the factors like temperature, rainfall, pH, and humidity. The proposed paper uses the “Adaptive Lemuria” algorithm for advanced crop prediction. For feature learning and pre-training, the suggested model includes the Restricted Boltzmann Machine which is part of the Deep Belief Network. Training and testing of the model are done with Decision tree and K-Means clustering (HDTKM) with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Naïve Bayes Classification. The forecast generated by the proposed algorithms helps farmers decide which crop to cultivate for maximizing production, depending on various features. The proposed framework is implemented in Python with Anaconda Spyder. The algorithm attains about 95.3% accuracy with an error rate of 0.035.
